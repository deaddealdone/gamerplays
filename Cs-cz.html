        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter video game developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by Valve Corporation. It was released in 2004 as a follow-up to the original Counter-Strike game.

            Condition Zero builds upon the gameplay of the original Counter-Strike, which is a team-based multiplayer game where players assume the roles of either terrorists or counter-terrorists. The objective varies depending on the game mode but typically involves planting or defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, or eliminating the opposing team.
            
            One notable feature of Condition Zero is its inclusion of a single-player campaign, which was absent in the original Counter-Strike. The single-player mode includes a series of missions where players take on the role of a counter-terrorist operative and engage in various objectives across different locations around the world. These missions are played against AI-controlled bots instead of human players.
            
            In addition to the single-player campaign, Condition Zero also includes multiplayer modes that allow players to compete against each other online. It features several classic Counter-Strike maps as well as new ones, and players can choose from a variety of weapons and equipment to customize their loadout.
    
            Condition Zero received mixed reviews upon its release. While it introduced some new features and content compared to the original game, some players felt that it did not live up to their expectations. However, it still has a dedicated player base and is often played alongside newer iterations of the Counter-Strike series, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p><br><br>
