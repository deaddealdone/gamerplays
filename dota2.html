        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the standalone sequel to the original Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 was officially released in July 2013 and is available for free on the Steam platform.

          In Dota 2, two teams of five players each compete against each other, with the goal of destroying the enemy team's Ancient, a large structure located in their base. Players control powerful heroes, each with unique abilities and roles, and work together to secure objectives, kill enemy heroes, and gain advantages over their opponents.
          
          The game features a large roster of over 100 heroes, each with their own playstyle and abilities. Players can choose from a variety of roles, such as carry, support, midlaner, offlaner, and jungler, to create a balanced team composition. The strategic depth of Dota 2 comes from the complex interactions between heroes, items, and the map.
          
          Dota 2 has a competitive scene with numerous tournaments and leagues, including The International, which is the game's premier annual tournament. The prize pool for The International is crowdfunded, with contributions from the community. Dota 2 has a steep learning curve, requiring teamwork, coordination, and strategic decision-making to succeed at a high level.
